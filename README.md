Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 

Hello!
My name is Brett Cotler. I am in the 5th years Masters in Data Science program, so I just finished my undergrad at Brown and this will be my first and only year in the program. 

I am from a town of about 30,000 people called Northbrook, IL. It is 20 miles north of Chicago. 

My favorite food would be a lobster roll, which I only discovered after moving to New England. 

I am extremely passionate about combatting climate change. I hope to apply my data science skills to climate work upon completion of the program. And I am very much looking forward to learning data engineering in DATA1050!
